The Institute of Engineering & Technology, DAVV, commonly known as IET or IET DAVV, stands as the engineering institution affiliated with Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya. Established in 1996 as an autonomous body, it operates on a self-financed model. Situated in close proximity to Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya's Takshashila Campus on Khandwa Road in southeastern Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India, IET DAVV holds approval from key regulatory bodies such as the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi, the Government of Madhya Pradesh, and the University Grants Commission (UGC). Notably, in the academic year 2009â€“10, prior to the establishment of IIT Indore's permanent campus at Simrol, IET DAVV served as the temporary campus for the prospective institute of national significance.
